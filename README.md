# IS2043PROJECT2

This project was a relative success, most of the shell scripts ran just fine, the only script that gave me difficulty was the backup script as the file pathing was different on my computer. I'm quite unfamiliar with bash in general, so it was nice to branch out and experiment with something other than java or c. The process to completing this project was rather straightfoward, just read through the tutorial and copy the given code for each different shell script after experimenting with the commands to get a better grasp on what's really happening during each step.

Code Review: Samuel Myers
I really liked your code, specifically the code blocks involving the if-else statement, the while loop, the for loop, and the until loop. The code was nice, neat, and straight to the point.
